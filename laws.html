            No society can exist without rules and laws in place. Chernogorsk's Quarantine Zone is no exception! Please make sure to acquantince yourself with all of them. Ignorance is no excuse! All of our rules and laws can also be found in the communities Discord. On the <strong>server-rules</strong> and <strong>qz-laws</strong>. 
          </p>
          <p>There's a 3 strike system implemented:</p>
          <li>
            1st Strick = 24hr timeout
          </li>
          <li>
            2nd Strike = week timeout
          </li>
          <li>
            3rd Strike = Ban
          </li>
          <p> 
            All ban/timeouts are decided by the mod team and we aim to keep punishments as fair as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you witness anyone being unpleasant towards other members, please report it via support tickets, and if you find someone is breaking server rules you are required to report it to an admin.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have assigned warning levels individually to rules so everyone can clearly see the punishments for specific rule breaks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rules with “RP ONLY” will need to be clipped or assessed by admins before punishments are dealt. “RP ONLY” rules must start with a roleplay interaction. Failure to roleplay before engaging in conflict will result in punishment.
         </p>
          <p class="important-message">
            <strong> DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THE RULE BROKEN, AUTOMATIC 3 STRIKES CAN BE GIVEN</strong>

            </p>
            <p>If you are sick you become subject to an “infection check” by an official FEDRA medical officer.</p>
            <p>
              If a civilian is found to have a frequent cough you will be detained and tested. 1 dose of medicine will be given.</p>
            <p>
              If the cough is not cured you are considered “infected” and will be taken for execution.
            </p>
            <p>
              FEDRA impose martial law over the Quarantine zone and its surrounding area and a night time curfew will happen within the safe zone to fight infection & insurrection.
            </p>
            <p>
              The infection is taken very seriously for the sake of the remaining population. If uncured it will spread very quick.
